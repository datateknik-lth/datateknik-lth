#Risk Management

"A risk is a potential problem; a problem is a risk that has materialized" [Fairley 1994]

##What can go wrong?
 * Staff turn-around: quit, moved to other project, illness
 * Tools do not work as anticipated
 * Requirements change more than expected
 * Effort estimates were wrong
 * Expected input/deliveries are delayed
 * Quality is not good enough in the end of the project

##What is risk?
 "An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project's objective"
 It consists of both a **cause** and an **effect**
 For example:

 - Use of new compiler (**cause**)
 
  Integration problem && delayed training phase (**effect**)

 - Low top management priority in Project A (**cause**)

   Resources (staff) moved from project A to another project (**effect**)

###Risky commitments - Overscoping
The main risk of overscoping is that the project target (scope)
will not be met in *time* and on budget (*cost/effort*).

 * The traditional dev model (waterfall) - sequential & doc-driven

   "*overpromise* software capabilities in cortractually binding requirements
   specification before they *understand* their risk implications."

 * Agile dev model (XP/Scrum) - iterative & code driven

   "... neat ideas... I'll code 'em up, and if they *don't fit* other 
   peoples ideas, we'll just evolve things until they work."
   
###Risk Management

 * Risk Assessment
   - Identification (What might go wrong?)
   - Analysis & prioritization (What are the most serious risks?)
 * Control of risk
   - Planning & Resolution
   - Monitoring

#### Approaches to risk identification:
 Includes but isn't limited to:
 * Use of checklists, check which risks may come up based on previous experience.
 * Brainstorming - getting knowledgeable stakeholders together to pool concerns.
 * Casual mapping - Identifying possible chains of cause and effect using a map.

                               /                  \                
                              /                    \              
                             /                 (Poor project outcome)                     
                            /                            \              
                           /                              \              
                          /                                \              
(Unrealistic schedule estimates)                      (Lack of skill)
