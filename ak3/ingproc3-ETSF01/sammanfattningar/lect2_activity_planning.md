# Activity planning

> Time is natures way of stopping everything happening at once.

## The objectives of activity planning
- Feasability assessment
  * Is the project possible within the required timescales and resources?
- Resource allocation
  * What are the most effective ways of allocating resources? When should
    the resources be available? 
- Detailed costing
 * How much will the project cost? After producing an activity plan, we can
   obtain more detailed estimates of costs.
- Motivation
 * Providing targets and monitoring progress can motivate staff.
- Coordination
 * When do the staff need to be transfered between projects to increase 
   efficiency?

## Different types of planning
 * Iterative planning
 * Gradual detailing

## Activity networks

 ```
           ____  
          |____| 
    ____ /      \ ____
-->|____|        |____|-->
         \ ____ /
          |____|
 ```

 Activity networks can be used to assess the feasability of the projects completion
 date, identify when resources are needed, calculate when costs incur, and to coordinate
 the staff between tasks.

## Defining activities
  
  An activity includes:

  * Start and end-time
  * Resource requirements
  * Duration
  * Dependencies

## Identifying activities

  There are three approaches to identifying the activities or tasks:

  - Activity based planning
   * Creating a list of all the activities that the project needs. Can be done by creating 
     a **Work Breakdown Structure** (WBS). This involves identifying the main tasks that are 
     needed for the project and then breaking them down into lower-level tasks. Too great depth
     will result in a large number of small tasks that will be diffcult to manage. Too shallow
     project provides insufficient detail.

  - Product-based approach
   * Consists of producing a **Product Breakdown Structure** (PBS) and a **Product Flow Diagram** (PFD).
     The PFD idicates for each product which other products are required as inputs. With the help of a 
     PFD you can easily create an ordered list of activities by identifying the order of products and
     which acitivies are needed for them.

  - Hybrid approach
   * The hybrid approach is a mix of both. Instead of creating a WBS that is based on the projects 
     activities, you create a WBS that is based on the projects products. 

## Network planning models
  
  - Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT)
  - Critical Path Method (CPM)
  - Precedence network

### Rules for project networks:
  
  * Should have only one start node.
  * Should have only one end node.
  * Every node has a duration.
  * Links normally don't have a duration.
  * Precedence are the immediate preceding activities.
  * Time moves from left to right.
  * A network may not contain loops.
  * No dangling activities.
